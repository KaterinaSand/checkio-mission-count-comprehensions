            To quote "The Zen of Python",
            "There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it."
            <br>
            And it is with the ast module which is meant to read python syntax and help you walk in it:
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://docs.python.org/library/ast.html">official documentation</a> ;</li>
                <li><a href="https://greentreesnakes.readthedocs.io">additional documentation</a>.</li>

        <div class="question">
            This is a big module, what should I use first?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            First you need to parse the code with <code>ast.parse(source)</code>.
            <br>
            You can display the tree with <code>ast.dump</code>.
            Note that since python 3.9, it has an useful keyword argument "indent".
            For example: <code>print(ast.dump(tree, indent=4))</code>.

        <div class="question">
            It seems complicated to go through that tree. How should I do it?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            There are three ways to go through a tree:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <code>ast.walk</code>:
                    Generates all nodes in the tree in no specified order.
                    Useful if you don't care about the context.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>ast.NodeVisitor</code>:
                    Walks the tree and calls a visitor function for every node found
                    (visitor methods you can implement by subclassing this class).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>ast.NodeTransformer</code>:
                    Walks the tree and allows modifications.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="question-answer">
        <div class="question">
            There are so much classes in this module. What should I use?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            You are looking for <code>ast.ListComp</code>, <code>ast.SetComp</code>,
            <code>ast.DictComp</code> and <code>ast.GeneratorExp</code>.
